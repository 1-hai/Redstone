# Redstone ND Server Project

Notice: Please update the scripting file only. stickz will bump the version, compile and push to the servers.

Notice 2: Plugins which use natives are NOT permitted to have the auto-updater feature due to server crashing.

Looking for: An automated build script to compile pull requests and copy the plugin to /updater/plugin_name/plugins.
